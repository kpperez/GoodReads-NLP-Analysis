#### Background 
This is an Analysis of the GoodReads "Books That Everyone Should Read At Least Once" list found on Kaggle. One of the main focuses of this project is Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant. 

#### Tools
Python for Data Cleaning, Data transformation, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, and Data Modeling. 

#### Data Set
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/best-books-10k-multi-genre-data).
